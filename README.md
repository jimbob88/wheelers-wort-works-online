# wheelers-wort-works-online
A rebuild of Wheeler's Beer Engine written in Python Online

A preview is available on [my repl](https://wheelers-wort-works-online--jimbob88.repl.co)

This version of `wheelers-wort-works-online` is being archived in place of my newer `www-online` repository because that was a private repository in which I have been continuing this project, although it is close to a dead-end at this point due to limitations in the REMI engine
